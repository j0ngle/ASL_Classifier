# Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains all of my machine learning projects from Summer 2021. A brief description of each project can be found below. I tried to explain what I as doing in detail throughout each project.

# ASL Classifier
An ASL Classifier neural network that can detect signs from the American Sign Language alphabet, including space, del, and nothing. It uses a standard neural network architecture and achieved 97% accuracy in mmy tests. Potential future work includes real time integration with Snapchat via Lens Studio

# DCGAN
A Deep Convolutional Generative Adverserial Network (DCGAN) to generate art. It is not yet complete, but once it is, I will modify it to a Progressive Growing GAN (PGGAN) to generate higher resolution artwork
