# Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains all of my machine learning projects from Summer 2021. A brief description of each project can be found below. I tried to explain what I as doing in detail throughout each project.

# ASL Classifier
An ASL Classifier neural network that can detect signs from the American Sign Language alphabet, including space, del, and nothing. It uses a standard neural network architecture and achieved 97% accuracy in mmy tests. Potential future work includes real time integration with Snapchat via Lens Studio

# DCGAN
Deep Convolutional Generative Adverserial Network (DGCAN) designed to learn to replicate landscape paintings from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/ipythonx/wikiart-gangogh-creating-art-gan) dataset. 

Architecture based on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/jadeblue/dcgans-and-techniques-to-optimize-them) tutorial, but many modifications were made along the way. 

After 6 hours of training, *okay* results were made (emphasis on the "okay"). I think it could do better with more training, but I want to try reworking it as a Progressive Growth GAN (PGGAN), found in another Colab file.
